The Airbnb Analysis project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data from the travel industry and property management domain. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas and various data analysis and visualization tools, we aim to extract valuable insights into pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and location-based trends in Airbnb listings.



The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Establishing a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieving Airbnb dataset efficiently.
2. Cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure data integrity and consistency.
3. Developing a Streamlit web application with interactive geospatial visualizations.
4. Analyzing and visualizing pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
5. Examining availability patterns and demand fluctuations across seasons.
6. Investigating location-based insights for specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. Creating interactive visualizations for user exploration.
